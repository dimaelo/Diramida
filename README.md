## 🎯 Mission

Diramida is an open-source research and development platform that bridges artificial intelligence, simulation, gaming, systems thinking, and creative technologies to address complex global challenges. 

We believe technology should: 
- **Serve people** rather than replace them
- **Be transparent** and explainable
- **Enable learning** through interaction and experimentation
- **Foster resilience** in complex adaptive systems
- **Combine** scientific rigor with creative exploration

## 🌟 Core Principles

1. **Technology as a Tool, Not an End** — Systems are built to serve defined human goals. 
2. **Transparency First** — Complex systems must be explainable and auditable. 
3. **Learning Through Interaction** — Understanding emerges from experimentation.
4. **Adaptive Stability** — Resilience comes through flexible response, not rigid control.
5. **Creative + Logical** — Art, science, and engineering reinforce each other.
