# Diramida
Diramida is a multidisciplinary platform combining AI, gaming, simulation, and creative technologies. Focused on education, research, streaming, and collaborative development, it explores future systems, digital resilience, and human-centered innovation through interactive and open tools.
Diramida

Diramida is an open, multidisciplinary platform focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence, simulation, gaming, cloud technologies, and human-centered innovation.
The project is designed as a research, experimentation, and creative space where technology is explored not as an abstract concept, but as a practical tool for resilience, education, and future systems design.

Purpose

Diramida exists to:

Explore applied AI in simulations, games, and real-time systems

Combine scientific thinking with creative and interactive media

Build transparent, modular, and understandable technological concepts

Support learning, experimentation, and collaboration across disciplines

The platform does not aim to replace existing systems, but to connect ideas, tools, and people into a coherent framework.

Core Areas
Artificial Intelligence

Applied AI concepts

Human-AI interaction

Decision-support and simulation logic

Ethical and transparent system design

Gaming & Simulation

Strategy and simulation games as research environments

Philosophy

Diramida follows several core principles:

Technology should serve people, not replace them

Complex systems must be explainable

Learning is most effective through interaction

Stability is achieved through adaptation

Creativity and logic are complementary

The project is intentionally open-ended and evolves through iteration.

Status

Diramida is an active and evolving project.
Some components are experimental, some conceptual, and others practical.
Documentation and structure are continuously improved.
