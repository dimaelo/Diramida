## What We Consider Vulnerabilities

### In Scope
- Code injection or execution flaws
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Data exposure or leakage
- Denial of service attacks
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without practical impact
- Social engineering or user error
- Third-party service issues
- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access
- Outdated dependency notifications only

- Sensitive code has additional scrutiny
- Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities

### Dependencies
- Regular updates of third-party libraries
- Security alerts monitored
- Outdated dependencies flagged

### Documentation
- Security guidelines documented
- Safe usage patterns provided
- Known limitations disclosed

### Transparency
- Security fixes disclosed responsibly

## Responsible Disclosure Timeline

1. **Report received** — Acknowledged within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** — Details verified (2-3 days)
3. **Fix development** — Solution created (5-14 days)
4. **Testing** — Fix validated (2-5 days)
5. **Release** — Patch published
6. **Disclosure** — Details shared publicly

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix issues
