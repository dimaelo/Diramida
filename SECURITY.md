## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly to the maintainers.

### How to Report

1. **Email:** dimaelo@github.com (or via GitHub private security tab)
2. **Response time:** Within 48 hours
3. **Resolution time:** 14-30 days depending on severity

### What to Include

Please provide:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Affected versions or components
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Potential impact or severity
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information (optional)

## What We Consider

### In Scope
- Code injection or execution flaws
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Data exposure or leakage
- Denial of service attacks
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Configuration security issues

### Out of Scope
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without practical impact
- Social engineering or user error
- Issues in third-party services
- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access
- Outdated dependency notifications (use Dependabot)

---

## Responsible Disclosure

### Our Timeline
1. **Report received** — Acknowledged within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** — Details verified (2-3 days)
3. **Fix development** — Solution created (5-14 days)
4. **Testing** — Fix validated (2-5 days)
5. **Release** — Patch published
6. **Disclosure** — Details shared publicly

### We Ask That You
- Give us reasonable time to fix before public disclosure
- Do not share details publicly until fix is available
- Allow time for dependent projects to update
- Work with us to coordinate disclosure

## FAQ

**Q: What if I'm not sure if something is a security issue?**  
A: Report it anyway. It's better to be cautious.  We'll determine scope together.

**Q: Can I discuss this in public channels first?**  
A: Please don't. Direct reports to maintainers privately instead.

**Q: Will my report be kept confidential?**  
A: Yes.  Only relevant parties are informed until a fix is released.

**Q: What if someone exploits a known vulnerability?**  
A:  Retaliation against reporters is strictly prohibited. We support responsible disclosure.
